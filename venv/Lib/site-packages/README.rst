Django-machina
##############

Django-machina is a forum framework for Django providing a way to build community-driven websites.
It offers a full-featured yet very extensible forum solution:

* Topic and post editing
* Forums tree management
* Per-forum permissions
* Anonymous posting
* Polls and attachments
* Moderation and pre-moderation
* Forum conversations search
* ...

Django-machina was built with integration in mind: the application is designed to be used inside
existing Django applications. It is not a standalone forum solution.

Django-machina was built with customization and extensibility in mind: each single functionality
of the application can be customized or overriden to accommodate with your needs.
